    <h1>Timeline of MRI Development in China</h1>
    <div class="timeline">
        <div class="event">
            <h2>1982: Initiation of MRI Development</h2>
            <p>In 1982, the National Science and Technology Commission of China organized a research project for the development of MRI technology. This marked the beginning of China's journey in developing MRI technology domestically.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
            <h2>1986: Establishment of Shenzhen Anke Company</h2>
            <p>The establishment of Shenzhen Anke Company in 1986 marked a significant milestone in China's pursuit of independent MRI development. This initiative was supported by the National Planning Commission and the National Science and Technology Commission, highlighting the importance of developing MRI technology locally.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
            <h2>1987: First 1500 Gauss Permanent Magnet MRI</h2>
            <p>In 1987, China successfully developed its first 1500 Gauss permanent magnet MRI at Anke Company. This achievement was a result of meticulous efforts in designing and optimizing the magnetic field uniformity, gradient coils, and imaging software.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
            <h2>1988: ASP-015 Permanent Magnet MRI</h2>
            <p>Anke Company unveiled the ASP-015 permanent magnet MRI system, capable of capturing clear images of the human head. This was a landmark achievement, signifying the beginning of China's capabilities in low-field permanent magnet MRI research.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
            <h2>1992: First Superconducting MRI (0.6T)</h2>
            <p>In 1992, Anke Company developed China's first superconducting MRI system with a 0.6T field strength. This system provided clearer internal images and was particularly advantageous for early detection of major diseases.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
            <h2>2005: Founding of United Imaging</h2>
            <p>Dr. Xue Min founded United Imaging in 2005, aiming to push the boundaries of medical imaging technology in China. This company would later become a significant player in the development of advanced MRI systems.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
            <h2>2007: China's First Self-Developed 1.5T MRI</h2>
            <p>United Imaging introduced Centauri 1.5T, China's first 1.5T MRI system with independent intellectual property. This development broke the monopoly of foreign brands in the high-field MRI sector.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
            <h2>2008: Entry into the US Market</h2>
            <p>Centauri 1.5T, developed by United Imaging, became the first Chinese-made MRI system to enter the US market. This was a significant breakthrough, showcasing China's growing capabilities in high-field MRI technology.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
            <h2>2015: Launch of 71cm Large Aperture 1.5T MRI</h2>
            <p>United Imaging launched the 71cm large aperture 1.5T MRI, which received FDA approval. This product featured advanced digital acquisition and transmission technologies, catering to a broader patient demographic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
            <h2>2019: ASTA 1.5T MRI System</h2>
            <p>The ASTA 1.5T MRI system was introduced with enhanced features such as real-time, lossless data transmission and higher image clarity, pushing the boundaries of rapid imaging technology.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
            <h2>2020: World's First 75cm Large Aperture 3.0T MRI</h2>
            <p>United Imaging launched the uMR Omega, the world's first 75cm large aperture 3.0T MRI, accommodating larger patients and those with claustrophobia, setting a new standard in patient-centered MRI design.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
