#### Background and Development
Computed Tomography (CT) scanning is a medical imaging technique that uses X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of the body. The first CT scanner marked a revolution in diagnostics, and its history involves key figures like Sir Godfrey Hounsfield and William H. Oldendorf.

Hounsfield, an engineer at EMI Central Research Laboratories in the UK, developed a prototype in the late 1960s, inspired by imagining how to determine the contents of a box using X-rays from all angles. The first clinical scan, conducted on a patient with a suspected brain tumor, took place on October 1, 1971, at Atkins Morley Hospital in London, with results published in 1972.

William H. Oldendorf, a neurologist, conceived the idea in 1959 and had a working prototype by 1961, filing a patent in 1963. His work was foundational, but it did not lead to the first clinically used scanner, facing rejection from manufacturers at the time.

#### Unexpected Detail: Funding and Inspiration
An interesting aspect is that Hounsfield's work was partly funded by a grant from the British Department of Health and Social Security, and his idea reportedly came during a country ramble, highlighting the serendipitous nature of scientific discovery.

### Survey Note: Comprehensive History of the First CT Scanner Machine

The history of the first computed tomography (CT) scanner machine is a fascinating tale of innovation, involving key figures like Sir Godfrey Hounsfield and William H. Oldendorf, and marking a significant milestone in medical imaging. This note provides a detailed exploration of its development, clinical use, and broader impact, drawing from historical records and scholarly sources.

#### Origins and Development
The concept of CT scanning emerged from the need for detailed cross-sectional imaging, surpassing the limitations of traditional X-rays. Sir Godfrey Hounsfield, an engineer at EMI Central Research Laboratories in Hayes, United Kingdom, is widely credited with developing the first practical CT scanner. His inspiration reportedly came during a country ramble, imagining how to determine the contents inside a box using X-rays from all angles. This idea led to the creation of a prototype head scanner, initially tested on small pigs, human vertebrae, preserved human brains in formalin, and fresh kosher cow brains, before being used on himself and eventually patients.

Hounsfield's work began in earnest in 1967, and by 1971, the scanner was ready for clinical testing. The machine used a novel approach, taking 160 parallel readings through 180 angles, each 1° apart, with a scan time of over 5 minutes and image processing taking an additional 2.5 hours. Early devices did not initially include an onboard computer for image generation; instead, data was stored on magnetic tape and transported by car to an EMI lab about 20 kilometers away for processing, with initial image collection taking up to 9 days.

#### First Clinical Use and Public Recognition
The first clinical CT scan was performed on October 1, 1971, at Atkins Morley Hospital in Wimbledon, London, on a patient with a suspected brain tumor, specifically a cerebral cyst. This scan, which took about 5 minutes and produced two 13-mm thick image slices, revealed a cystic mass about the size of a plum on the left frontal lobe. The results, published on April 20, 1972, triggered a sensation in medical X-ray technology, comparable to the discovery of X-rays themselves. This event marked the beginning of computed tomography's widespread adoption, setting a new course for medical imaging.

Hounsfield's contributions were recognized with the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which he shared with Allan MacLeod Cormack, whose theoretical work complemented Hounsfield's practical innovations. The principles developed by Hounsfield remain in use as of 2025, underscoring the lasting impact of his work.

#### Contributions of William H. Oldendorf
While Hounsfield's scanner is considered the first clinically used CT machine, William H. Oldendorf, a neurologist at UCLA and the Los Angeles VA Hospital, also played a pivotal role. Oldendorf conceived the idea in 1959 and completed a working prototype by 1961, filing a patent in 1961 for a "radiant energy apparatus for investigating selected areas of interior objects obscured by dense material," which was granted in October 1963. His work, costing $1700 for the patent application, laid the foundation for later imaging techniques, including MRI, positron emission tomography, and SPECT. However, his prototype did not lead to the first industrial CAT scanning device, facing rejection from a leading X-ray manufacturer in 1961.

Hounsfield acknowledged Oldendorf's work as the only other attempt at tomographic reconstruction, and Oldendorf shared the Ziedses des Plantes Gold Medal in 1974 and the Albert and Mary Lasker Award for Clinical Research in 1975 with Hounsfield for "concepts and experiments which directly anticipated and demonstrated the feasibility of computerized tomography." Notably, Oldendorf was not awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize, a decision attributed to a tradition favoring basic science researchers over applied research, despite nomination by Rosalyn Yalow.

#### Commercialization and Evolution
The first commercial CT scanner, the EMI-Scanner Mark I, was installed at the Mayo Clinic in the United States in 1973, marking the beginning of widespread clinical use. This machine focused on brain tomographic sections, with image data acquisition taking about 4 minutes for two adjacent slices and computation time of about 7 minutes per picture, using an 80×80 pixel matrix and a water-filled Perspex tank with a pre-shaped rubber head-cap. By 1975, Hounsfield introduced the first whole-body scanner, expanding the technology's applications.

Siemens Healthineers entered the field after a visit to EMI’s research lab in 1972, led by Friedrich Gudden, and began testing their prototype, SIRETOM, at Goethe University Medical Center in Frankfurt from mid-1974, with series production starting in November 1975. This competition drove rapid advancements, with companies like General Electric and Siemens soon producing enhanced, full-body scanners, while EMI eventually exited the market due to competition.

#### Technical Details and Early Challenges
The early CT scanner was rudimentary compared to modern devices. The initial model at Atkins Morley Hospital did not include a computer for image generation, requiring data to be processed off-site, which limited efficiency. Scan times were lengthy, and the process was labor-intensive, but it provided unprecedented detail, revolutionizing diagnostics for conditions like brain tumors, strokes, and other internal abnormalities.

#### Impact and Legacy
The introduction of CT scanning transformed medical diagnostics, with 3 million examinations performed by 1980, growing to over 68 million annually by 2005. The technology's portability also evolved, with mobile CT scanners emerging in the 1970s, such as the world's first mobile unit launched by Medical Coaches Inc. in Peru, focusing on head and heart scans. By the 1990s, portable/mobile CT scanners grew in popularity, particularly for stroke care, with mobile stroke units (MSUs) explored from 2003.

The IEEE recognized Hounsfield's achievement with a Milestone ceremony on October 26 at the EMI Old Vinyl Factory in Hayes, England, sponsored by the IEEE United Kingdom and Ireland Section, with a plaque displayed at Jupiter House, the former EMI head office. Funding for Hounsfield's work included a British Department of Health and Social Security grant of around US $40,000 (approximately $300,000 in 2025 figures), highlighting the public and private collaboration behind this innovation.

This period, starting around 1980, marked the commencement of the CT imaging epoch in China, as noted in historical medical literature. The import of early head and body CT sets reflected China's efforts to modernize its healthcare system following the reform and open-up policy of 1978, which facilitated technological advancements and international collaboration. By the end of 1997, China had approximately 3,000 CT scanners, indicating rapid growth, with rural community hospitals also acquiring scanners, reaching a capacity of 8.6 per million population by later estimates.

#### CT Scanners for Animals

CT scanning technology has been adapted for use in veterinary medicine, providing detailed imaging for diagnosing injuries and diseases in animals. The history of CT for animals likely parallels its human applications, with the technology being adapted shortly after its clinical success.

- **Development and Use**: CT scanners are used in veterinary practices for examining the skull, thorax, abdomen, and orthopedic structures in animals. They offer non-invasive, high-resolution imaging, allowing veterinarians to visualize soft tissues, bones, and other structures in detail without the need for surgery. Animals who are candidates for CT scans include those with nasal cavity disease, tumors, or orthopedic issues.

- **Historical Context**: The application of CT scanning in veterinary medicine followed its success in human medicine. Specialized scanners and protocols have been developed to cater to the needs of different animal species, such as dogs, cats, horses, and wildlife. Notable projects include the openVertebrate (oVert) project, which from 2017 to 2023 took detailed CT scans of over 13,000 vertebrate specimens, including amphibians, reptiles, fishes, and mammals, for research purposes.

- **Benefits and Applications**: CT scans in veterinary medicine are particularly useful for diagnosing conditions that are difficult to assess with traditional radiography, such as complex skull anatomy or internal organ diseases. Recent advancements, like the purchase of a large animal table for CT scanners at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine in 2023, have enabled imaging of large animals like horses, particularly for studying conditions inside their heads.
